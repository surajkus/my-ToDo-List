# Simple To-Do List

This is a small project to create a minimalistic to-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them.

## Things You Can Achieve by Maintaining a To-Do List

✔ Stay organized
✔ Stay focused
✔ Remind yourself
✔ Set daily goals
Features

    Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks by typing in the input box and pressing the "Add" button.
    Task Completion: Clicking on a task marks it as completed with a strike-through effect.
    Delete Tasks: Tasks can be deleted by clicking the "×" button.
    Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to fit various screen sizes.

Usage

    Clone this repository:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list.git

    Open the index.html file in any browser to use the app.

    Add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks as needed.

How It Works

    The app uses plain JavaScript to handle task addition, completion, and deletion.
    Tasks are displayed as list items, and they toggle a checked class when clicked.
    Each task includes a close button to remove it from the list.

3. **Save the Changes**:
   - After editing, save the file.

4. **Stage and Commit**:
   - Add the resolved file to the staging area and commit the changes:
     ```bash
     git add filename
     git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in ToDo List project"
     ```

This way, you combine the best parts of both versions while ensuring the merge conflict is resolved properly.
